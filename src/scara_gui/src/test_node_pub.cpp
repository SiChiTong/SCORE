	 * node.  advertise() returns a Publisher object which allows you to
	 * publish messages on that topic through a call to publish().  Once
	 * all copies of the returned Publisher object are destroyed, the topic
	 * will be automatically unadvertised.

	 * used for publishing messages.  If messages are published more quickly
	 * than we can send them, the number here specifies how many messages to
